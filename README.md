# Murad's Projects

Welcome! Here I showcase my personal and academic projects!

Some projects are only code-based while others include explanations and visualizations. The projects are as follows:

1) Deplatforming project
Developed and deployed a survey experiment on Amazon MTurk, using statistical t-tests to demonstrate a preference for deplatforming disliked over tolerated groups. Applied linear regression to identify factors affecting attitudes toward deplatforming. Tools used: Qualtrics, Amazon MTurk, R.

2) Canadian Wage Analysis
Collated 2023 wage data by hour across Canadian provinces and territories to explore and present wage disparities among regions and across various job categories according to the federal classification system.
Tools used: Python and Tableau.

3) Baseball Statistics Visualization
Tools used: Tableau
Analyzed and visualized different baseball player attributes (weight, height, etc.) and explored the relationship between the attributes and achievement records such as homeruns and batting averages. Established the existence of a correlational relationship through regression analysis on Tableau.

4) R Shiny Open-Ended Web Application (portion of code)
Created an R Shiny web application that simplifies survey open-ended coding
Tools used: R, R Shiny

5) VBA Macro for automated drivers' analysis and visualization (portion of code)
Created a VBA Macro that automates drivers' analysis for bivariate (X,Y) data analysis and scatterplot visualization
Tools used: VBA (Macro within Microsoft Excel)
